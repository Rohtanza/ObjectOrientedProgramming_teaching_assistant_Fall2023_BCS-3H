1.
                Understand string data type
                Difference between char[X], char*
                Also, study these methods
                variable.size()
                variable.length()
                sizeof(variable)
                Also, add at least two other methods

                You have been assigned the task of developing a Student Management System for a university. The system should be able to store information about students and their courses.
                1) Create a “Student” class with the following attributes:
                Student ID (int)
                Name (string)
                Total students enrolled (int)
                2) Create a “Course” class with the following attributes:
                Course Code (string)
                Name (string)
                3) Create a relationship between the “Student” class and the “Course” class. A student can be enrolled in multiple courses. Use pointers to dynamically allocate memory for students' courses.


                4) Implement functions in the “Student” class to enroll a student in a course and display the list of courses in which the student is enrolled.

                5) In the “main()” function, demonstrate the functionality by creating student and course objects, enrolling students in courses, and displaying the enrolled courses for each student.
